# RealTimeStylus StylusSyncPlugin

This project implements the IStylusSyncPlugin interface to subscribe to
RealTimeStylus events. Inspired by the SDL-based demo from
https://backworlds.com/under-pressure/

Works best with a tablet and stylus. The window is normally green, and turns
red when the user activates the eraser by pressing the eraser button or
inverting the stylus.
